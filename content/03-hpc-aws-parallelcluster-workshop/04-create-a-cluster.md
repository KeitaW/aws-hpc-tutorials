In the previous step you connected to **PCluster Manager**. Now we will create a cluster using the Cluster Creation Wizard:

1. **Click** on one of the two *Create Cluster* buttons.

2. **Enter** the name of your cluster. Here we have chosen `my-cluster`, but feel free to pick your own cluster name. **Select** the *Wizard* and **Click** the *Next* button.

3. **Select** the region to be *us-east-1*, and **select** your default VPC.

3. **Select** the *Head Node Instance Type* to be `c5.large`, then pick a *Subnet ID*. Then, **Set** the *Keypair* to `ee-default-keypair` if running the lab at an AWS Hosted event. One is created with your temporary account on Event Engine, use that one. The *Root Volume Size* should be **35**, if not the case, please **set** this value. Once done, **enable** the *Virtual Console* as shown below and **click** on the *Next* button.

4. On the storage page of the Wizard, do not change the defaults and **click** on *Next*.

5. When you reach the Queues page, **select** a *Subnet ID* (any will do). Select **On-Demand** for the *Purchase Type* if not already selected. Then, set the field *Static Nodes* to **0** and *Dynamic Nodes* to **10**. This means that when your cluster launches it will have 0 compute nodes but that it can scale up to as many as 10 instances when jobs are submitted. For the *Instance Type*, select **c5.xlarge** (you can use the search field to make it easier to find this instance type). Finish by **clicking** on the *Next* button.

6. The last Wizard page provides an overview of the configuration file that ParallelCluster will use to deploy your cluster. Your configuration file should look similar to the image below. **Click** on *Dry Run* to perform a validation of your configuration. Once your configuration has been validated, you can **Click** on *Create* to initiate creation of your HPC cluster.

It'll take about 5 to 7 minutes to create all of the required resources for your cluster. You can check the *Stack Events* tab in PCluster Manager to see the progress of your cluster creation. You can also connect to your AWS account sandbox and go to the [AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) page. Once your cluster is created, you can move on to the next section.
